          <h1>Submissions</h1>
          <h3>General Forum</h3>
          <p>The Sequentials team invites scholars, artists, and critics to submit
          original visual scholarship on any academic, social, or artistic subject.
          Submissions may be of any length and may be either a large, single image or a
          series of “pages” to be displayed sequentially. All submissions will be blind
          reviewed by the Sequentials editorial team and accepted comics will be published
          online on a rolling basis.</p>

          <p>To submit, please upload a submission title, cover letter, and
          high-resolution images to the “Sequentials – General Call for Comics” category
          of the Submittable platform here: https://trace.submittable.com/submit. For
          questions concerning submissions, please email Ashley Manchester at
          manchester@ufl.edu.</p>

          <h3>Special Issue: "'Queer' as Noun, Adjective, and/or Verb"</h3>
          <p>In the complex and rich history of queer theories, activisms, and practices,
          the term “queer” has been deployed in a variety of ways. In “Sex in Public,”
          Lauren Berlant and Michael Warner look at queerness and queer culture as “a
          world-making project,” a process of continual action with subversive potential
          (Berlant and Warner 558). José Esteban Muñoz, too, considers queerness to be a
          sort of horizontal (rather than teleological) temporality that comprises a
          utopian futurity and potentiality. In Time Binds, Elizabeth Freeman discusses
          “queer” as simultaneously a way of being and a mode of action, positioning
          queers as “denizens of time out of joint,” and queerness as “rhythmic
          improvisations of the social” (Freeman 19, 172). Judith Butler, in Bodies That
          Matter, looks at queerness’ relations to discourse and performativity, arguing
          that “queering” is a “sudden gap in the surface of language” (Butler 130).</p>

          <p>For Sequentials’ second special Call For Comics, we seek visual
          interpretations of the complexity of queer existence, discourse, and theoretical
          concepts. We are particularly interested in submissions that comment on the
          relationship between various deployments of the term “queer” and concepts of
          visibility, visuality, and art-as-activism. Submissions must be illustrated in
          comics form and can visualize, for instance, a particular interpretation of a
          given theorist’s concept(s), a unique contribution to the field of queer theory,
          or the possible connection between comics and queer theory.</p>

          <p>Possible topics may include, but are certainly not limited to:</p>
          <li>“Queer” as noun, adjective, and/or verb</li>
          <li>Queer performativity</li>
          <li>Intersectionality (queerness as co-constitutive with race, class, gender, etc.)</li>
          <li>Queer futurity</li>
          <li>Queer utopias</li>
          <li>Theories of negativity and anti-relationality</li>
          <li>Queer time and/or space</li>
          <li>Queer history</li>
          <li>LGBTQ+ activisms</li>
          <br/>

          <p>By “comics,” we loosely mean illustrated, sequential images that may
          or may not incorporate words and may or may not be bounded within panels
          or other boundary markers. We invite submissions from individuals in all
          academic disciplines, regardless of their level of experience with
          comics or illustration “skills.” Further, submissions will be welcomed
          from non-academics, as well, and the editorial team at Sequentials will
          consider all submissions equally. Submissions may be of any length and
          may be either a large, single image or a series of “pages” to be
          displayed sequentially. All submissions will be blind reviewed by the
          Sequentials editorial team.</p>

          <p>We strongly encourage contributors to consider how the comics form
          can interpret, envision, or reflect meanings associated with the given
          topic. To submit, please upload a submission title, cover letter, and
          high-resolution image(s) to the “Sequentials 2 – ‘Queer’ as Noun,
          Adjective, and/or Verb” category of the Submittable platform here:
          https://trace.submittable.com/submit by December 1, 2017. If you have
          any questions, please contact Ashley Manchester at
          manchester@ufl.edu.</p>
